title: 'Relationship between adposition placement and basic word order'
level: 2

The type of [[adposition]] found in a language (i.e. preposition or postposition) is correlated with the language's [[basic word order]].

In verb-object languages, adpositions tend to come before the noun, hence **prepositions**. In object-verb languages, adpositions tend to come after the noun, hense **postpositions**.
