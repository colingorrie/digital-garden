An **adposition** is one of a class of words that occurs alongside nouns to express precise relationships between the and other elements of the sentence, e.g. English _in_, _at_, _of_, _to_, _with_, _despite_. In English, these are called **prepositions**.

Crosslinguistically, these words may occur either _before_ or _after_ nouns. When they occur after nouns, they are called **postpositions**. An English example of a postposition is _notwithstanding_, as in the sentence _Your objections notwithstanding, we shall proceed._.[^1] Because the term preposition implies something that precedes the noun, we use the term **adposition** to cover prepositions and postpositions.

[^1]: The English word _notwithstanding_ can appear either as a postposition (e.g., in _your objections notwithstanding_) or a preposition (e.g., in _notwithstanding your objections_).

Whether a language uses prepositions or postpositions is strongly correlated with the language's [[basic word order]]. See: [[Relationship between adposition placement and basic word order]].
