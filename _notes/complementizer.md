**Complementizers** are a [[grammatical category]] which is used to allow a [[clause]] to serve a [[grammatical function]] (e.g. subject, object) within a larger sentence. English examples include the words _that_,[^1] _if_, and _whether_.

[^1]: The English word _that_ is not always a complementizer. Consider the difference in function between the complementizer _that_ in _I know that you are here._ the [[demonstrative pronoun]] _that_ in _I know that._, and the demonstrative adjective _I know that man._. These usages are related historically.

In traditional grammar, complementizers are part of the larger category of [[conjunction]]. Specifically, they are traditionally considered **subordinating conjunctions** (as opposed to **coordinating conjunctions** such as _and_ or _or_).

## Complementizers and word order

Conjunctions can appear either on the left or the right side of the clause. As with much crosslinguistic variation in word order, there are correlations with [[basic word order]]: object-verb languages tend to have complementizers appear on the right side of the clause (often attaching as suffixes to the verb).

> [김치는 맵지만] 맛있어요  
> _[kimchi-neun mep-jiman] masiss-eoyo_  
> [kimchi-TOP spicy-although] tasty-POLITE  
> ‘Although kimchi is spicy, it is tasty.’ (Korean)

Verb-object languages, by contrast, tend to have conjunctions appear on the left side.

> _Je sais [que tu es là.]_  
> I know [that you are there]  
> ‘I know that you are there.’ (French)
