There are two pitfalls that beginning [[conlang|conlangers]] face:

1. Making a language that is too much like English (or another [[Standard Average European]] language)
2. Making a "kitchen-sink language", a language which incorporates every linguistic phenomenon you know about

Without exposure to a wide variety of other languages, there is a danger that you’ll end up making a version of English with the words swapped out (a **relex**, or relexification of English). There’s nothing wrong with this _per se_, but it's usually not what conlangers are aiming to do.

However, once you learn about a wide variety of languages, another temptation arises: the temptation to add all the features you’ve ever learned about into a single language. In practice, this makes for an excessively complicated, difficult to learn, and above all, unnatural language.
