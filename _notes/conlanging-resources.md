## Grammatical description

### Academic

- [[payne1997describing]]: It was written for field linguists writing descriptive grammars but it works really well for conlanging.

### Non-academic

- Anything written by [Mark Rosenfelder](http://zompist.com/) on conlanging, starting with the [Language Construction Kit](http://zompist.com/lckbook.html).

## Reference Grammars

- The ultimate form of documentation for your language is a descriptive/reference grammar.
  - You can see what these look like by searching “[language name] reference grammar”
  - Many are available for free, and give good inspiration not only for how to write a grammar, but also for linguistic features you might be able to imitate.
- You can also look at grammars written for conlangs. Excellent examples:
  - [Siwa](https://kupdf.net/download/a-descriptive-grammar-of-siwa_58f688dadc0d60f931da97e8_pdf) (Étienne Poisson)
  - [Kahtsaai](https://lingweenie.org/conlang/kahtsaai.pdf) (William S. Annis)
