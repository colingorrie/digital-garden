title: 'Demonstrative pronoun'
---

The **demonstrative pronouns** are a set of [[pronoun|pronouns]] that allow speakers to refer to things by their nearness or farness (see [[deixis]]). In English, we have _this/these_ (near) and _that/those_ (far). Other languages distinguish three degrees of demonstratives, as did earlier versions of English (_this, that, yonder_).

This nearness can be spatial, temporal, or used in a more abstract sense.
