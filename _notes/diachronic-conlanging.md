title: 'Diachronic conlanging'

- [[Neogrammarian hypothesis]]: Sound change is regular
- Because sound change is regular and applies to all languages, we expect a realistic looking [[conlang]] to show evidence of sound change.
- Therefore, one way to make a realistic-looking conlang is first to make an earlier form of the language, and then apply some changes.
