- [[Neogrammarian hypothesis]]: Sound change is regular
- Because sound change is regular and applies to all languages, we expect a realistic looking [[conlang]] to show evidence of sound change.
- Therefore, one way to make a realistic-looking conlang is first to make an earlier form of the language, and then apply some changes.

- If you’re interested in making a rich language for world-building, I highly recommend the historical approach
  - Examine how some present-day languages have evolved from ancient languages.
  - How have their sounds changed? How have their words’ meanings changed? How has their grammar changed?
- You can take inspiration from history to make your languages feel like a part of history too.
- Another good book for embedding cultural and historical details into conlangs is Mark Rosenfelder’s [The Conlangers Lexipedia](https://www.zompist.com/lexipedia.html).
