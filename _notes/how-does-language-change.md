## Phonological change

- Mergers:
  - _cot_ vs _caught_, _hock_ vs _hawk_, _stock_ vs _stalk_ (many North American Englishes)
  - _wine_ vs _whine_, _whether_ vs _weather_, _which_ vs _witch_ (most dialects of English)
- Loss:
  - Lat. _historia_ [histoɾia] => Spanish _historia_ [istoɾja]
    - note: \<h\> is still spelled; spelling tends to be conservative
- Change:
  - Old French chat [tʃat] ‘cat’ => Mod. French [ʃa(t)]

## Lexical change

- New words are created
- Words are lost
- Words change meaning:
  - narrowing (_deer_ ‘any animal’ => ‘Cervidae’)
  - broadening (_barn_ ‘building for storing barley’ => ‘building for storing any grain’)
  - shifting (_challenge_ ‘false accusation’ => ‘difficult task’)

## Morphological change

- Loss of morphology
- Remnant of dative case marking in English: in old-en times => in old times
- New morphology (often from grammaticalization)
- Old English. _hād_ ‘state, condition, rank’ => Modern English _-hood_

## Syntactic change

- Change in basic word order: Latin SOV => French SVO
- Change in specific constructions: _I know not_ => _I do not know_.
