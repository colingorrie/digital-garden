Consider a language with a verb _ak_ ‘to be’. This language inflects its verbs for person like so:

- 1st person: -_i_
- 2nd person: -_to_
- 3rd person: -_a_

This gives us the paradigm in Stage 1 of the language:

- _ak-i_ ‘I am’
- _ak-to_ ‘you are’
- _ak-a_ ‘he/she/it is’

But imagine this language undergoes palatalization, so Stage 2 looks like:

- _atʃ-i_ ‘I am’ (k > tʃ / \_i)
- _ak-to_ ‘you are’
- _ak-a_ ‘he/she/it is’

Then it undergoes consonant assimilation, yielding Stage 3:

- _atʃ-i_ ‘I am’
- _at-to_ ‘you are’ (k > t / \_t)
- _ak-a_ ‘he/she/it is’

Then unstressed vowels delete, with the following result in Stage 4:

- _atʃ_ ‘I am’
- _at_ ‘you are’ ([t] also degeminates)
- _ak_ ‘he/she/it is

So by the operation of a perfectly regular process of sound change, we produce a very irregular verb! See [[Sturtevant's paradox]].
