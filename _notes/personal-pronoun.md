title: 'Personal pronoun'
level: 1

All languages[^1] have a set of [[pronoun|pronouns]] which let speakers refer to different [[discourse participant|discourse participants]] (speaker, addressee, both, neither). These are called **personal pronouns**. Some languages, e.g. Spanish, allow you to drop personal pronouns when they are the subject of the verb (see: [[pro-drop]]). English does not.

> (Yo) cant-o  
> 1SG sing-1SG (1st person, singular)  
> ‘I sing.’ (Spanish)

[^1]: This is controversial. Some linguists have argued that some languages, for example Japanese, do not have personal pronouns.
