title: "Learners' output proceeds along predictable paths"

---

Second language learners' output follows predictable developmental sequences.

For example, regardless of first language background, learners acquire English negation through the following stages (reproduced from [[vanpatten2015introduction]]: 10):

1. *no* + phrase, e.g. *No want that,* 
2. subject + *no* + phrase, e.g. *He no want that.*
3. *don't, can't, not* may alternate with *no*, e.g. *He can't/don't/not want that.*
4. Negation is attached to modal verbs: *He can't do that.*
5. Negation is attached to auxiliaries: *He doesn't want that.*

There are also orders of acquistion for certain grammatical structures. For example, English verbal affixes are acquired in the following order:

1. the *-ing* suffix 
2. the regular past tense suffix *-ed* 
3. irregular past tenses, such as *went*
4. the 3rd person singular present tense suffix *-s*

Learners often exhibit [[U-shaped learning]], where they start out doing something correctly, then incorrectly, and finally correctly once again.
