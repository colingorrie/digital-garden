Second language learners' output follows predictable developmental sequences.

For example, regardless of first language background, learners acquire English negation through the following stages (reproduced from [[vanpatten2015introduction]]: 10):

1. _no_ + phrase, e.g. _No want that,_
2. subject + _no_ + phrase, e.g. _He no want that._
3. _don't, can't, not_ may alternate with _no_, e.g. _He can't/don't/not want that._
4. Negation is attached to modal verbs: _He can't do that._
5. Negation is attached to auxiliaries: _He doesn't want that._

There are also orders of acquistion for certain grammatical structures. For example, English verbal affixes are acquired in the following order:

1. the _-ing_ suffix
2. the regular past tense suffix _-ed_
3. irregular past tenses, such as _went_
4. the 3rd person singular present tense suffix _-s_

Learners often exhibit [[U-shaped learning]], where they start out doing something correctly, then incorrectly, and finally correctly once again.
