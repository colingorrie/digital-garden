title: 'Second language learners acquire knowledge beyond what is present in the input'
level: 2
---

Learners acquire unconscious knowledge about the language they are learning that could not have come exclusively from the input.

For example:

- Learners learn constraints on what is grammatical in a language which are not explicitly taught and not evident in what they hear or read.
- Learners learn about ambiguity: in the sentence _Albert asked Bill if he was a bear_, the point of controversy could be whether Albert is a bear or Bill is a bear.
