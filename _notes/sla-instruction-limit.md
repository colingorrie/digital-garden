title: "The effect of instruction on second language acquisition is limited"

---

The findings regarding the efficacy of instruction on [[Second language acquisition]] is mixed. Counterintuivitely, instruction is not always helpful.

- Instruction sometimes has no effect on acquisition.

	It cannot allow learners to skip steps in developmental sequences (see [[Learners' output proceeds along predictable paths]]).

- Instruction can sometimes slow down acquisition.

- Instruction can sometimes speed acquisition and allow learners to reach higher levels.

The circumstances under which instruction is effective are an active and controversial area of research.
