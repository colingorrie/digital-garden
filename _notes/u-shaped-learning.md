title: "U-shaped learning"

---

U-shaped learning is a developmental trajectory which commonly occurs in the development of new cognitive skills, including [[Second language acquisition]]. The name comes from the shape of the curve on a graph with time on the x-axis and skill level on the y-axis.

There are three phases:

1. Early apparent high skill, reflecting simple memorization of unanalysed responses. (*went*)
2. Middle low skill, reflecting the development of analysis. Responses are analysed but suffer from overgeneralization. (*goed*)
3. Eventual high skill, representing mature analysis. (*went*)

U-shaped learning has been found in a variety of domains, including:

- learning new words
- learning mathematical algorithms
- building muscle strength
