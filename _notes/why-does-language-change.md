title: 'Why does language change?'

## Imperfect transmission

- Every generation learns the language anew
- They need to reconstruct in their own minds the grammar that the adults have
- But sometimes what the adults produce is consistent with multiple possible representations (lexical, grammatical, etc)
- As a result, language tends to **drift** over time
- e.g. _a napron_ => _an apron_
  - why? the string of sounds [əˈneipɹən] is consistent with both [ə] + [ˈneipɹən] and [ən] + [ˈeipɹən]

## Bias (natural processes)

- Certain facts about the human body and mind make certain patterns easier than others, especially in fast or casual speech
- With repetition, these patterns can become ingrained even in careful speech
- These include articulatory, acoustic, and cognitive biases
- e.g. _in_ + _possible_ => _impossible_
  - it’s hard for the speech organs to change from one place of articulation to another in between consonants

## Language contact

- Through migration, trade, and war, populations speaking different languages come into contact with each other
- In such situations, individuals may become partially or fully bilingual and words, sounds, and grammar can travel from one language to the other

## Social differentiation

- Language is used to mark group identity
- Since people often value belonging (or not belonging) to particular social groups, they will adopt or abandon particular linguistic features to fit in better
- This usually involves acceleration of other types of change
